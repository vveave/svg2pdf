Convert SVG files to PDFs.

This crate allows to convert static (i.e. non-interactive) SVG files to
either standalone PDF files or Form XObjects that can be embedded in another
PDF file and used just like images.

Generate API documentation locally with `cargo doc --workspace --no-deps`.

## Library

```rust,no_run
# fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
use svg2pdf::{ConversionOptions, PageOptions};

let svg = std::fs::read_to_string("input.svg")?;
let tree = svg2pdf::usvg::Tree::from_str(&svg, &svg2pdf::usvg::Options::default())?;
let pdf = svg2pdf::to_pdf(
    &tree,
    ConversionOptions::default(),
    PageOptions::default(),
)?;
std::fs::write("output.pdf", pdf)?;
# Ok(())
# }
```

`PageOptions::dpi` and `ConversionOptions::raster_scale` must be finite and
greater than zero. Filter effects are rasterized, and temporary filter images
are limited to 16,777,216 pixels (approximately 64 MiB of raw RGBA data) to
prevent excessive memory use. Invalid settings and oversized filter regions
are reported through `ConversionError`.

## CLI

This crate also contains a command line interface. Install it by running the
command below:

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/vveave/svg2pdf.git svg2pdf-cli
```

You can then convert SVGs to PDFs by running commands like these:

```bash
svg2pdf your.svg
```
